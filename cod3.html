    Call of Duty 3 is a 2006 first-person shooter video game developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. It is the third major installment in the Call of Duty series.
    It was released for PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It was a launch title for the PlayStation 3 and Wii in North America, Europe and Australia. <br>
    Call of Duty 3 is a historical first-person shooter game that has a single-player campaign mode and multiplayer mode.
    It is open-ended, giving the player multiple paths to complete objectives, but plays similarly to the series' previous installment.
    Players fight alongside AI-controlled teammates against enemies who use various attack patterns, hide behind cover, and regroup to improved defensive positions.<br><br>
    A character can be positioned in one of three stances: standing, crouching, or prone, each affecting the player's rate of movement and accuracy.
    Two firearms can be carried, and both fragmentation and smoke grenades can also be equipped; unlike previous installments in the series, players have the ability to toss live grenades back at the enemy.
    Weapons and ammo from fallen foes or friendlies can be picked up to replace weapons in a player's inventory. A player may fire from the hip or aim down the gun's iron sights for increased accuracy.
    The compass on the heads-up display (HUD) helps the player navigate to the location of each objective.<br>
    Using cover helps the player avoid enemy fire or recover health after taking significant damage.
    Similar to Call of Duty 2, the edges of the screen turn red and the character's heartbeat will increase in volume, indicating that the player's health is low;
    it can be replenished through an automatic recovery system when the character is not taking fire.<br><br>
    The player takes the perspective of either an American, British, Canadian, or Polish soldier during the single-player campaign, for a total of 14 missions.
    Set in the Western Front of World War II, Call of Duty 3 takes place in the year 1944 and contains missions specific to four major Allied campaigns in the Battle of Normandy.
    The player takes part in a series of objectives marked by their HUD; these include having the character arrive at a checkpoint, eliminate enemies in a specified location, manning a tank, and marking targets for air strikes.
    Call of Duty 3 introduces to the series scripted close-combat sequences and multiple actions to arming explosives, both of which require the player to press buttons in sequences to progress.
