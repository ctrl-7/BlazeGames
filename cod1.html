<div class="bck" style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size:20px; color:lightblue"> Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. 
    It is the first game in the call of duty franchise released on October 29, 2003 for Microsoft Windows.
    The game simulates infantry and combined arms warfare of World War II using a modified version of the id Tech 3 engine. Much of its theme and gameplay is similar to the Medal of Honor series.
    However, Call of Duty showcases multiple viewpoints stages in the British, American and Soviet theaters of World War II.
    The game introduced a new take on AI-controlled allies who support the player during missions and react to situational changes during gameplay.
    This led to a greater emphasis on squad-based play as opposed to the "lone wolf" approach often portrayed in earlier first-person shooter games. 
    Much of Infinity Ward's development team consisted of members who helped develop Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. The game received critical acclaim and won several Game of the Year awards from reviewers.
<br><br>
    As a first-person shooter, Call of Duty places the player in control of an infantry soldier who makes use of various authentic World War II firearms in combat. 
    Each mission features a series of objectives that are marked on the heads-up display's compass; the player must complete all objectives to advance to the next mission.
    The player can save and load at any time, rather than the checkpoint system utilized in later Call of Duty games. <br><br>
The player has two primary weapon slots, a handgun slot, and can carry up to ten grenades. Weapons may be exchanged with those found on the battlefield dropped by dead soldiers. 
Unlike later Call of Duty games, the first allows the player to toggle between different firing modes (single shot or automatic fire). 
Call of Duty was one of the early first-person shooters to feature iron sights in game play; by pressing the corresponding key the player aims down the gun's actual sights for increased accuracy. 
In addition to weapons carried by the player, mounted machine guns and other fixed weapon emplacements are controllable by the player.<br>
The game uses a standard health points system, with a limited amount of health reflected by a health bar. 
Medkits scattered throughout the levels or dropped by some foes are used to restore health when the player is injured.
<br><br>
Call of Duty also featured "shellshock": when there is an explosion near the player, he momentarily experiences simulated tinnitus, appropriate sound "muffling" effects, blurred vision, and also results in the player slowing down, unable to sprint.
<br>
As the focus of the game is on simulation of the actual battlefield, the gameplay differed from many single-player shooters of the time. 
The player moves in conjunction with allied soldiers rather than alone; allied soldiers will assist the player in defeating enemy soldiers and advancing; however, the player is given charge of completing certain objectives. 
The game places heavy emphasis on usage of cover, suppressive fire, and grenades. AI-controlled soldiers will take cover behind walls, barricades, and other obstacles when available.
<br><br>
The NPD Group named Call of Duty the eighth-best-selling computer game of 2003. It maintained this position on NPD's computer game sales rankings for the following year.
In the United States alone, Call of Duty sold 790,000 copies and earned $29.6 million by August 2006. At the time, this led Edge to declare it the country's 13th-best-selling computer game released since January 2000.
